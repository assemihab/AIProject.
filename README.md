The project aims to develop an intelligent algorithm that plays against the existing algorithm used in the Connect 4 game available at "http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/". By utilizing the powerful techniques of alpha-beta pruning and minimax algorithms, we aim to create an AI player using python that can compete effectively and make optimal moves in this classic board game, we also used script that convert the current state of the board to list of lists(by taking screenshot) and return the optimal move in form of mouse click.
